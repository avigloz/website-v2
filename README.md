hello! 👋

welcome to my website.

~ **some things i'm working on** ~

- [gloz.ai](https://gloz.ai) ➡️ ai-powered back-translation for any project with a global audience
- [vnsh.io](https://vnsh.io) ➡️ vibe-coded digital dead-drops for passing around small bits, bytes, and bobs


## what's 🆕

after some iterations, i've decided to simplify my website.

it's pretty barebones, eh? it'll stay that way, for a little while.
